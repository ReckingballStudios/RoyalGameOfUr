The Royal Game of Ur

A Fun little video about the board game
This Version of the Royal Game of Ur is played with 4 dice instead of 3, and follows the rules described in this video

Current version has you playing against a neural network!


100 Generations:
    After 100 Generations of training, the collection of neural networks have developed the strategy of sending individual tokens down the board at a time
    A great sight to view the complex behaviour, however the strategy can be thwarted by myself using a more defensive and capitalization strategy
