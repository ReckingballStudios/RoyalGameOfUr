The Royal Game of Ur

A Fun little video about the board game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I
This Version of the Royal Game of Ur is played with 4 dice instead of 3, and follows the rules described in the video

Current version has you playing against a neural network!


100 Generations:
    After 100 Generations of training, the collection of neural networks have developed the strategy of sending individual tokens down the board at a time
    A great sight to view the complex behaviour, however the strategy can be thwarted by myself using a more defensive and capitalization strategy

5908 Generations:
    After letting the program run overnight, the neural network has become mildly intelligent. It actually won the first game against me! It uses a strategy that mixes keeping a few tokens in the starting lane, and running up the board with single tokens.

Did some tweeks to the Neural Network and rechanged it. The neural network beats me quite often now.


Scoreboard:
Trained Neural Network:     2
Mason:                      8
